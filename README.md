Don't we all? Well, this project aims to help you on your way to doing just that. 
The core will be to build a list of good, well-made courses or lessons on subjects relating to programming. 
The core will be organized by language, but will later to move out into other fields.

We will begin by building up the list in `/json` so it can easily be used to populate the front end!
