Don't we all? Well this project aims to help you on your way to doing that. The core will be to build a list of good well made courses or lessons on subjects on and around programming grouped by language but later to move out into other feilds.

We will begin by building up the list in `/json` so it can easily be used to build a front end site on top of or even to be imported into a DB later should there be a need. For now though we will look to just use the json file(s).

## Want to add something? 

It is easy, just add it to the json file(s) in the same format as the others listed.
